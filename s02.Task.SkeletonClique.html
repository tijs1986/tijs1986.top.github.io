<h1>THE SKELETON CLIQUE FANBASE</h1>
<p class="pg-class03"><b>
    The Skeleton Clique is the official name of the fanbase of Twenty One Pilots. <br> 
    The Clique officially started during Regional at Best, with the introduction of Tyler <br> 
    and Josh's signature skeleton hoodies. However, in the Blurryface Era, <br> 
    the logo of the Clique was formed of a skeleton and alien. <br> 
    As evidenced by the masks worn during performances, the skeleton represents Tyler, <br>
    while the alien represents Josh. <br></b></p>
