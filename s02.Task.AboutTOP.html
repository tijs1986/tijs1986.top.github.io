<h1>THE BAND</h1>
<p class="pg-class04""><b>
    Band "twenty one pilots" was formed back in 2009 in Columbus, <br> 
    Ohio by college friends,Tyler Joseph (lead vocals, ukulele, piano, keytar, <br> 
    synthesizer) and Nick Thomas (bassist). Joseph came up with the band's name <br> 
    while studying "All My Sons" by Arthur Miller; a play about a man who <br> 
    commits suicide after causing the death of twenty one pilots during World War II <br>
    because he knowingly sent them faulty parts for the good of his business. <br>
    Joseph explains that this story of moral dilemma was the inspiration <br> 
    for the name of the band. On December 29, 2009, they released their debut, <br> 
    self-titled album and began touring Ohio. <br>
    In 2011, the drummer and bassist left due to busy schedules<br> 
    and Joseph was joined by a new drummer, Josh Dun.<br></b></p><br>
